## Homework - Assignment 4

### 1. What is the formal definition of the deadlock?

>

### 2. What are the four requirements for a deadlock?

>

### 3. Suppose that a resource allocation graph contains a cycle. Does this mean there is a deadlock?

>

### 4. Suppose that a resource allocation graph does not contain a cycle.  Does this mean there is no deadlock?

>

### 5. Consider a system with processes P1 and P2 and resources R1, R2, R3 (where each resource has a single instance). Draw a resource allocation graph for each of the following steps in the sequence and answer the following questions

>

#### a. Process P2 requests resource R1

>

#### b. Process P1 is granted access to R1

>

#### c. Processes both P1 and P2 claim both resources R2 and R3

>

### 6. Consider a three process system in which processes may request any of 12 drives. Suppose the allocation state given below. Show that the allocation state is unsafe. Will this system deadlock?

|      | Allocation |  Max  | Need  | Available |
| :--- | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :-------: |
| P0   |     5      |  10   |   5   |    12     |
| P1   |     2      |   4   |   2   |     -     |
| P2   |     3      |   9   |   6   |     -     |
